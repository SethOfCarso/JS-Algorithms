# JS-Algorithms
Currently this repo it is a combination of me doing :
    - Some research of how to implement algorithms in JS (Youtube, wikipedia and google)
    - Studying form Treknleb repo on algorithms [Check it here](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms).
    - Studying for an interview to land a job.

So this repo contains JavaScript based examples of many popular data structures (ATM, planning to add algorithms).
Each data structure have an example of how to do it.
