# JS-Algorithms
Currently this repo it is a combination of me doing :
    - Some research of how to implement algorithms in JS (Youtube, wikipedia and google)
    - Studying form Treknleb repo on algorithms [Check it here](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms).
    - Studying to be a better engineer and also to land a job ASAP, contact me by @: cardona.erick@hotmail.com

So this repo contains JavaScript based examples of many popular data structures (ATM, planning to add algorithms).  
Each data structure have an example of how to do it and also adding some basic comments so anyone can read it and learn from it.  


# Done

-   [Linked List](https://github.com/SethOfCarso/JS-Algorithms/tree/master/DataStructure/Linkedlist)  
-   [Double Linked List](https://github.com/SethOfCarso/JS-Algorithms/tree/master/DataStructure/DoubleLinkedList)  
-   [Queue](https://github.com/SethOfCarso/JS-Algorithms/tree/master/DataStructure/Queue)  
-   [Stack](https://github.com/SethOfCarso/JS-Algorithms/tree/master/DataStructure/stack)  
-   [Hash Table](https://github.com/SethOfCarso/JS-Algorithms/tree/master/DataStructure/HashTable)  -It's done, need to revisit to rewrite it.
-   [Heap](https://github.com/SethOfCarso/JS-Algorithms/tree/master/DataStructure/Heap)  
-   [Priority Queue](https://github.com/SethOfCarso/JS-Algorithms/tree/master/DataStructure/stack)  
-   [Trie](https://github.com/SethOfCarso/JS-Algorithms/tree/master/DataStructure/Trie) - It's done, need to revisit to rewrite it.  
-   [Tree](https://github.com/SethOfCarso/JS-Algorithms/tree/master/DataStructure/Tree)   - This is just a base for the trees.  
    -   [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/SethOfCarso/JS-Algorithms/tree/master/DataStructure/stack)  


# Currently working on (To-do)
-   AVL Tree  
-   Red-Black Tree  
-   Segment Tree  
-   Fenwick Tree  
-   Graph  
-   Disjoint Set  
-   Bloom Filter  


## How to run it

-   Just run the HTML of each folder, and play with the file name ###Test.js  
-   Pro tip: user debugger and run it to see how it work.  

## Ideas to add

The idea is to add to each list a read me with some type of summary of each data structure, some info / basic operations, some extra info for it.  
After I'm done with datha structures im going to add test to each one, then doing some algoritms.
Feel free to ask me anything throught email.
